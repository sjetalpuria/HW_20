              BOOKNEST- An app designed for booklovers.
            </h1>

            <p>
                The Book Club App is a perfect place to
                 discover and discuss books of all kinds, 
                 with anyone, anywhere. With everything going 
                 on in the world, you will be able to create groups, 
                 meet with Authors, and discuss the ins and outs of 
                 your favorite books virtually. This app will lend its 
                 hand to the busy people who are still interested in 
                 having a sense of belonging by having access to cliff 
                 notes and personal notes from the last meeting, as well 
                 as having access to Goodreads.

                The Problem
            </h1>
             
            <p>
              In this busy world book lovers, love to attend bookclub meetings and talk about the book that they 
              have read. But they are unable to attend those due to several reasons like busy schedule and lack of 
              transportation.

                The Solution
            </h1>
             
            <p>
              To rescue from the problem, I designed an app which is lite and is easily accessible
              everywhere and anytime. By including this app in their daily life, the readers can
              to cope up with the bookclub meetings, get recommendations on various books 
              to read and make new friends to share their book reviews.

            <p>
                I collected the information from the user by 
                conducting the User Interviews and Surveys. I 
                then transformed it into my data and created the User 
                persona. By the use of user persona I created the 
                lo-fi version of the product.

              Survey
          </h1>

          <p>
              I used google forms to create the survey and send it out 
              to various readers and non-readers and gathered the data as shown below.
              When interviewing and surveying our users, we found that a lot of the people wanted to join a book club but 
              could not find the time to do so. Users also did not have the knowledge or resources to start/join a book club on their own. 

                Majority of the users prefer Fiction over Non-Fiction
                50% of users listen to audiobooks while the other 50% read physical books

            Feature prioritization Matrix
        </h1>

        <p>
            After doing user Interviews, I laid out the answers of the users and 
            created feature prioritization matrix in which I catorgized them in terms of 
            high priority to the users to low priority to the users and high priority freatures to app to 
            low priority features to app. This helped me to decide which features to include first on in Booknest.
